-- This file will outline my understanding of each concept --
> Starting from the top, we first included the chunk header file and a chunk c
file, in the header file we defined the methods and the structs that will be
used for the chunk.
-> In the chunk struct there is metadata, to handle the growing or freeing of
the dynamic array in the chunk struct. That dynamic array is a collection of
opcodes that will be used in the VM and iterated through.

 > Next up the memory header and c file, the methods GROW_CAPACITY, GROW_ARRAY
 and FREE_ARRAY, are handling memory for the chunks, with the core of the
 entire program revolving around reallocate, that takes in the type of the
 array, a pointer to the array, the oldSize and a newSize. It explictily does
 either grow the array if oldSize is too small for the needed purpose, or it
 frees up some memory if specified
 
 > Next up is the debug header file and its corresponding c file, the debug file
    for now has the disassembler that takes the bytecode interaction in the
    machine and returns human friendly information to work through, it has a set
    of instructions that are passed into the switch statement for specific
    instructions, for now it takes an instruction and performs that operation
    and thus increments the offset to the next item in the chunk array, now the
    link between this portion of the program and the next one will be explained
    next
 > And the final one for now, where we have the value header file and its C
    file, in this file we find a few methods and a struct that holds another
    dynamic array along with a new double data structure/type idk what to call
    it. The new dynamic array will hold the constants that are passed to the
    chunk array that can be referenced by the disassembler to output, the offset
    in the disassembler comes into play here since once the offset is
    incremented it points to the next element in the chunk array which if the
    preceeding one was a opcode/instruction the next one is likely to be a
    operand/constant, thus it can read that data and output it.
    This is it mostly to my understanding of the moving parts of the interpreter
    so far.

-- What have I learnt --
> Structs and there interactions with pointers and how pointers generally work.

> typecasting and typecasting to pointers ( *Exposed to it by the memory header
 file at reallocate* )
